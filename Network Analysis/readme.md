In this project, I attempt to analyze a network dataset.

Following are the objectives:
1. Analyzing the network by understanding its degree distribution (pdf, ccdf).
2. Centrality and community detection: Evaluate various centrality measures (closeness centrality, eigen value centrality). Detect the communities in the network.
3. Analyze and simulate percolation network models such as SI, SIR, SIS models.
